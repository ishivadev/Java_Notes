✅ Interview Answer — Class

A Class is a blueprint or template that defines properties (variables/data) and behaviors (methods/actions) for objects.
It does not occupy memory until an object is created.

Example:

class Student {
    int rollNo;
    String name;
    void study() {}
}

Here, Student is a class — it only defines data and behavior, but does not store actual values.



✅ Interview Answer — Object

An Object is a real-time instance of a class that occupies memory and stores actual data.
An object can access the methods defined in the class.

Example:

Student s1 = new Student();
s1.rollNo = 101;
s1.name = "Shiva";
s1.study();

s1 is an object — it stores data and uses methods defined in the class.



🌟 One-line difference (very effective in interviews)
Class								Object
A blueprint or template				A real instance created from a class
No memory allocated					Memory allocated
Defines variables & methods			Stores values and can call methods



🔥 Small story format (optional but impressive)

Class = Design / Plan (example: Car blueprint)

Object = Real item created from design (example: Actual car we drive)



🎤 Final short answer to speak in interview

- A Class is a blueprint that defines variables and methods. It doesn’t store values until an object is created.
- An Object is an instance of a class that occupies memory, stores data, and can access the methods defined in the class.
