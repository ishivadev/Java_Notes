✅ What is a Keyword in Java?

A keyword in Java is a reserved word that has a predefined meaning for the Java compiler.
It cannot be used as a variable name, class name, or method name, because Java uses it internally for specific purposes.



🔹 Why do we use Keywords?

Because they:

Define the structure of Java programs

Specify data types, control flow, class behavior, object creation, memory management, etc.



🔹 Types of Keywords (Grouped)
