🔥 Access Modifiers in Java

Access Modifiers define visibility / accessibility level of classes, variables, constructors, and methods.

📌 Types of Access Modifiers
Access Modifier			Visibility			Accessible From
public					Everywhere			Same class, same package, different package, subclasses
protected				Limited				Same class, same package, different package (only through inheritance)
(default) / no keyword	Package-private		Same class, same package only
private					Most restricted		Only within same class


🧠 Why do we use Access Modifiers?

To achieve:
Encapsulation
Security of data
Controlled access to class members
Code reusability and inheritance control

🏷️ Where do we use Access Modifiers?
Keyword				Used With
public				class, constructor, method, variable
protected			constructor, method, variable (not class)
(default)			class, constructor, method, variable
private				constructor, method, variable

Access Modifier
1). public		- within class, with in the package, outside of the package, everywhere. (public variable, public method, public class)
2). protected	- protected variable and methods can be in another class in same package only through inheritance. protected variable and methods can be used in another package only through inheritance.
3). default		- we can access class, variable and method within the package (class Test{}, void display(), int a)
4). private		- we can access variable and method within the class (private variable, private method)
